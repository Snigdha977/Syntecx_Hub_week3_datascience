Netflix / Media Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix-style media dataset to understand content distribution, trends, and patterns. The analysis focuses on content types, release year trends, genres, and runtime distributions. The project also generates visual outputs and summary reports automatically.

Objectives

Analyze the distribution of Movies and TV Shows

Study content growth over time using release year trends

Identify the most common genres

Analyze movie runtime distribution

Generate top-10 lists for genres and release years

Export visualizations and a summary report

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Dataset

File: netflix_titles.csv

The dataset is auto-generated by the script if not found.

An Excel version (netflix_titles.xlsx) is also created automatically.
